# doom-texture-mix
randomizes textures in doom levels

# Usage

python: 
python texture_mix.py wad_path

exe:
texture_mix.exe wad_path
or drag a wad onto it

# output

It'll create a wad in the local folder (or if you drag/dropped, in the original wad's folder) called output.wad

it'll probably overwrite any other output.wad so be careful
